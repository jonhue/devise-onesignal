## Installation

`devise-onesignal` works with Rails 4.0 onwards. You can add it to your `Gemfile` with:

```ruby
gem 'devise-onesignal'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install devise-onesignal

If you always want to be up to date fetch the latest from GitHub in your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'devise-onesignal', github: 'jonhue/devise-onesignal'
```

Now run the generator:

    $ rails g devise_one_signal

To wrap things up, migrate the changes into your database:

    $ rails db:migrate

**Note:** Use `rake db:migrate` instead if you run Rails < 5.

## Usage

First of all [create your OneSignal app](https://onesignal.com) and set your application ID in the created initializer (`config/initializers/devise-onesignal.rb`).

Now let's include the neccessary javascript files in our application (`apps/assets/javascripts/application.js`):

```js
//= require OneSignalSDK
//= require devise-onesignal
```

As a last step initialize the javascript component when your assets load. If you are using Rails 5 with Turbolinks, this could look like this:

```js
document.addEventListener( 'turbolinks:load', function() {
    OneSignalInit();
});
```

### Subscribing / unsubscribing users

This gem makes it fairly easy to subscribe and unsubscribe users from OneSignal. Just call the respective JavaScript function:

```js
OneSignalSubscribe();
OneSignalUnsubscribe();
```

### Backend

devise-onesignal introduces an `current_onesignal` method available in your controllers and views. It returns a hash:

```ruby
$ current_onesignal
{id: 'e9b66bc5-a1e5-4f3f-8a3e-894f576b193a', permission: 'allow', user: UserObject}
```

**Note:** When no user is associated with that ID, the returned hash does not include the key.

**Note:** If the user has not enabled OneSignal yet, the hash won't return an ID / user but it still returns the permission. In this case `denied` or `default`.

You can access the OneSignal PlayerId and Permission from the User object:

```ruby
$ User.first.onesignal_id
'e9b66bc5-a1e5-4f3f-8a3e-894f576b193a'
$ User.first.onesignal_permission
'allow'
```
