![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/onsignal.svg) <img src="https://travis-ci.org/jonhue/onsignal.svg?branch=master" />

A OneSignal API wrapper simplifying user targeted cross platform notifications. OnSignal consists of a JavaScript and a Rails API:

* [Rails API](https://github.com/jonhue/onsignal-rails): Attach OneSignal players to user records provided by an authentication solution.

## Usage

Handle user subscriptions to OneSignal in your frontend code.

### Overview

```javascript
import 'onsignal/dist/OneSignalSDK';
import OnSignal from 'onsignal';

document.addEventListener( 'ready', () => {
    const onSignal = new OnSignal( 'OneSignal App ID', {
        autoRegister: false
    });

    // Object to call OneSignal API from
    onSignal.oneSignal;

    // Current users player ID
    onSignal.playerId;

    // Current users permission
    onSignal.permission;
};
```

#### Options

Pass options to OneSignal's `push(['init', {...}])` function as a hash. Default values are:

* `autoRegister` Automatically try to subscribe the user when loading a page. Accepts a boolean. Defaults to `false`.
* `persistNotification` If set to `false `, automatically dismisses notifications after ~20 seconds in Chrome Desktop v47+. Accepts a boolean. Defaults to `false`.
* `welcomeNotification` Hash configuring the default OneSignal welcome notification. Accepts a hash. Defaults to `{ disable: true }`.
* `notifyButton` Hash configuring the default OneSignal notify button at the bottom right of the screen. Accepts a hash. Defaults to `{ enable: false }`.

### Subscribing

Just call `onSignal.subscribe();` and OneSignal will ask your user for permission to send notifications if he is not subscribed yet. _On the following request an existing `Device` object will either get updated or a new one will get created. (if using the Rails API)_

#### Options

Pass options to OneSignal's `registerForPushNotifications()` function as a hash. Default values are:

* `modalPrompt` Whether or not to use a custom prompt instead of the browsers default to ask for permission. Accepts a boolean. Defaults to `false`.

### Unsubscribing

**Note:** You most likely don't want to let your users unsubscribe from receiving notifications, but instead allow them to manually disable receiving any new notifications. For that purpose use the [notifications-rails](https://github.com/jonhue/notifications-rails) gem, which adds a notification API and detailed user settings.

If you want to completely remove a user from OneSignal, call `onSignal.unsubscribe();`.

### Additional functions

```javascript
// Check if a user is subscribed to OneSignal
onSignal.isSubscribed()
```
