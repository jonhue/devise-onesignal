# devise-onesignal

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/devise-onesignal.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/devise-onesignal) <img src="https://travis-ci.org/jonhue/devise-onesignal.svg?branch=master" />

Implement user targeted cross-platform notifications with OneSignal & Devise in your Rails app. Can also be used without Devise, but it is primarily intended to be used along with some sort of user-management-system.

This gem works well together with [notifications-rails](https://github.com/jonhue/notifications-rails) which introduces a notifications handling & pushing API. To build a cross-platform notification solution also add the [native](https://github.com/NativeGap/native-ruby) gem to your app.

## Installation

devise-onesignal works with Rails 5.0 onwards. You can add it to your `Gemfile` with:

```ruby
gem 'devise-onesignal'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install devise-onesignal

If you always want to be up to date fetch the latest from GitHub in your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'devise-onesignal', github: 'jonhue/devise-onesignal'
```

Now run the generator:

    $ rails g devise_onesignal

To wrap things up, migrate the changes into your database:

    $ rails db:migrate

It is time to [create your OneSignal app](https://onesignal.com) if you haven't already and set your application ID in the created initializer (`config/initializers/devise-onesignal.rb`).

Define an association in those models whose objects are supposed to be associated with OneSignal players. For example `User` in `app/models/user.rb`.

```ruby
has_many :devices, as: :owner
```

Now let us include the neccessary javascript files in our application (`apps/assets/javascripts/application.js`):

```js
//= require OneSignalSDK
//= require devise-onesignal
```

Finally initialize the javascript component when your assets load. If you are using Rails 5 with Turbolinks, this could look like this:

```js
document.addEventListener( 'turbolinks:load', function() {
    OneSignalInit();
});
```

## Usage

### Devise object

You most likely want to associate your devise object (e.g. `current_user`) with your OneSignal integration. Now, if your Devise model is called `User` and the `current_user` method is available you don't have to worry about that.

Let's say our Devise model is named `Admin`. Just add a `private` method to your `ApplicationController`:

```ruby
def set_device_owner
    current_admin if current_admin
end
```

**Note:** Essentially `set_device_owner` has to return a class object *or* `nil`.

### Device methods

devise-onesignal introduces a `Device` activerecord model. Every object of your devise class can have multiple devices, one for each device / browser they enabled OneSignal at least once.

```ruby
d = Device.first

# Returns object associated with device. Can return `nil`.
d.owner

# Returns OneSignal player id
d.onesignal_id

# Returns OneSignal permission ( `granted`/`denied`/`default` )
d.onesignal_permission

# Some timestamps
d.last_used
d.created_at
d.updated_at


# If device is ready to receive notifications
d.onesignal_enabled?

# If device has been disabled to receive notifications
d.onesignal_disabled?

# If device has been set previously to receive notifications or not
d.onesignal_set?
```

### current_device

In your controllers and views you can access a `current_device` method that returns the `Device` object of the current OneSignal subscription. If the user browsing your site is not subscribed to OneSignal, `current_device` returns an uncommitted `Device` object with some helpful information, like the `permission` attribute, set.

### Subscribing

Just call `OneSignalSubscribe();` in your frontend code and OneSignal will ask your user for permission to send notifications. On the following request an existing `Device` object will either get updated or a new one will get created.

### Unsubscribing

**Note:** You most likely don't want to let your users unsubscribe from receiving notifications, but instead allow them to manually disable receiving any new notifications. For that purpose use the [notifications-rails](https://github.com/jonhue/notifications-rails) gem, which adds a notification API and detailed user settings.

If you want to completely remove a user from OneSignal, call `OneSignalUnsubscribe();` in your javascript.

## Configuration

You can configure devise-onesignal by passing a block to `configure`. This can be done in `config/initializers/devise-onesignal.rb`:

```ruby
DeviseOnesignal.configure do |config|
    config.app_id = ''
end
```

**`app_id` (required)** Your OneSignal app id. Takes a string. Create one here: https://onesignal.com

**`auto_register`** Automatically try to subscribe the user when loading a page. Takes a boolean. Defaults to `false`.

**`persist_notification`** Automatically dismiss the notification after ~20 seconds in Chrome. Takes a boolean. Defaults to `false`.

**`subscribe_with_modal`** Show a modal instead of a native browser window when subscribing a user to OneSignal. Takes a boolean. Defaults to `false`.
